# bridgeflow-testnet
BridgeFlow is a permissionless middleware prototype that simulates cross-chain transactions, automatically finding optimal bridge routes, calculating fees, and showing real-time metrics in an operator dashboard — all inside a single Codespace.

This project runs a backend (Express + ethers) for quote simulation and metrics, and a frontend (React + Vite) with a wallet-connect bridge UI and live dashboard.
